This is the version of share and upload file developed by Shove1Bow1
To start this program:
1. Use npm install to download all the package file
2. Fill all the information into .env based on .env.example( I will add some comments to let you know what these values are)
3. Create a rsb database to connect to it. This RSB can be created from AWS or on your local machine(using docker compose)
4. Config AWS services, include your SES, S3 and Your RSB
5. Use "npm start" to run the server
Enjoy!!
Note: This is the first version so server sometimes maybe unstable, and code can be messy. Will try to update the code later
